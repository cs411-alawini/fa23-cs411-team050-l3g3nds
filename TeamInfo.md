## Project Summary
  Our project aims to streamline the process of finding new games for users. It has a wide range of features for effortless game exploration. We intend to achieve this by applying a similarity method to extract keywords by utilizing SQL's LIKE operator which will allow users to quickly identify compatible games. Furthermore, users can utilize preset filters such as Genre, Price, Platform, and Rating to discover games that align with their preferences. These filters are purposefully designed to provide comprehensive automated results.
  After initiating a search, the results of the query will appear below. The ability to sort these results using a drop-down menu will allow users to further refine their search by adding more filters, like the number of players, language, and application.
